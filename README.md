# Robot-Arm

This project is a beginner friendly robot arm made using basic servos and an Arduino Uno (See Bill of Material for more information). The arm can move in many direction and can perform tasks such as picking up and dropping an object using the gripper. 

The robot arm itself is controlled by calibrating potentiometers accordingly.
