# Robot-Arm

This project is a beginner friendly robot arm made using basic servos and an Arduino Uno (See Bill of Material for more information). The arm can move in many direction and can perform tasks such as picking up and dropping an object using the gripper. 

This repository offers two ways to control the arm:  

-Calibrating potentiometers  
-A GUI (Graphical User Interface) comprised of sliders and text entry to control the servos  

This project is meant to be added on over time and thus isn't a one time thing.
