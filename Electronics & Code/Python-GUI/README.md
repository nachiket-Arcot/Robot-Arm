Python GUI comprised of three files on the python side each for:

-Creating the interface
-Connecting to the Arduino Microcontroller
-A main file with the sole purpose of calling the functions created in the files aboce

And an Arduino Code that reads the data from the GUI and responds accordingly.

This GUI has allowed me to cut costs on unnecessary components to control the arm.
